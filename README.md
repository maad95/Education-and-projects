# Education and projects

  B.Sc. - 2018. Technical University of Kosice, Electrical Engineering:
  - Thesis: The use of digital filters in the control of a synchronous motor with permanent magnets.
  - Short description: The goal of this bachelor thesis is to process an overview of selected types of basic filters for use in controlling synchronous motor with permanent magnets. Advanced method of removing noise, specifically the usage of Kalman filter, is described and implemented in the conclusion of this thesis.
  - Developed parts: SW for FOC and digital filters. (Based on TI TMS320 DSP)

  M.Sc. - 2020. Technical University of Kosice, Electrical Engineering:
  - Thesis: Implementation of the EtherCAT communication bus in a modular converter for actuators
  - Short description: The aim of this thesis is to verify implementation possibilities of communication bus EtherCAT for modular servo drive for an actuator, which main computing member is a dual-core microcontroller from a C2000 family dedicated for system control in real-time.
  - Developed parts: Simple HW for connection between EtherCat module and modular servo drive. SW for transfer data between EtherCat module (Based on Beckhoff IC + TI TMS320 DSP)

  Ph.D. - 2023. Technical University of Kosice, Electrical Engineering:
  - Thesis: Control of power converters in multiport connection
  - Short description: The thesis describes several types of topologies of power multiport converters and points out the possibilities of their management and presents the topology of a multiport converter based on several transformers with parallel connected secondary windings, which is analyzed for both harmonic and non-harmonic quantities.
  - Developed parts: Design of planar transformer based on required parameters of multiport converter. SW for converter for power control and communication between other ports. (Based on TI TMS 320)
