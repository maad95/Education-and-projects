In this project, I designed the hardware part of the H-bridge for controlling a DC motor for students for school exercises.

The main requirements were:
- 50V, 10A
- DC link pre-charging controlled manually by switch and also by IO
- current sensor
- independent interface for connecting an incremental encoder, +5V and +15V supply (manually switchable)
- IOs isolated by optocouplers
- Many measuring points placed on PCB for observation every part of circuit
- All interfaces of H-bridge designed for control by RT-LAB HiL hardware
- Made as low-cost device on one-side PCB (home made) and parts found in Power Electronic Lab at KEM FEI TUKE
