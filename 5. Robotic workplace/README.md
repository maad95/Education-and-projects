Main goal of this project was re-design unused robotic workplaces with Fanuc LR Mate 200iD and Allen-Bradley Micro850 PLC with HMI panel for packaging snack bars to boxes

Process requirements:
  - 240 pcs/min of snack bars at highest speed (two robots used)
  - Packaging three, five or six snack bars in box (replaceable robot gripper)
  - Master - Slave operation / one robot operation
  - Some parts of production line were developed, it was necessary to use them


As team member of this project, I worked on the following taskt:
  - Design (calculation) of the electric motor and drive for the conveyor for snack bar align
  - Simulation verification of time intervals of process (Rockwell Arena Simulation Software)
  - Simulation verification of the robotic arm Fanuc movement in 3D model of real workplace (Fanuc ROBOGUIDE)
  - Design of electrical circuit of some parts of workplace
  - Design of pneumatic circuit of workplace

Design of conveyor for snack bars align (internally called also "reloader")
