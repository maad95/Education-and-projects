Development of supply and control board for vision (observation) system consist of three elements - block TV/day camera, thermal camera, LRF. Development of HW part with an emphasis on modularity, scalability, limited dimensions and with regard to the best EMC/EMI parameters.
Supply and control board connected together by vibration proof connectors. 

Requirements for supply board:
- DC/DC step-down from 24V (Â±3V) to 12V@5A and 5V@5A
- provides power supply for control board and all components of system 
- limited PCB dimensions
- possibility of installing a heatsing on the supply board

Requirements for control board:
- four communication interfaces, three for internal components of observation system, one for communication with external devices/systems
- internal componenets - block TV/day camera (UART), thermal camera (RS232), LRF (UART)
- external system communication by RS422
- same dimensions as supply board
- temperature sensing and control of fan for cooling

Control board is based on Atmel AVR MCU. Code is written in C language with a strong use of interruptions for communication protocols with handshaking/CRC. Temperature is sensing by NTC thermistor.

A cooler and a fan holder were also designed for the system. Cooling process started in case the temperature rose above the certain value.
These boards together form a modular equipment that meets the required parameters of power supply for system elements , modularity and installation dimensions.
