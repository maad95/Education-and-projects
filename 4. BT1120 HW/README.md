Development of this design follows up to project "Vision". Control board from "Vision" project was replaced by development board with HiSilicon SOC, which can proce video from various type of camera sensors. 
Main goal was merge video processing and communication management between system elements to one high performance SOC. Pictures below shows design of hardware for BT1120 video interface for connection between thermal camera and HiSilicon SoC.
